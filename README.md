## Weather Text Program
There are two goals behind this project.
1. To apply what I have been learning about Python outside of the classroom.
2. To give myself a way to access the weather forecast on my [cell phone](https://www.thelightphone.com/lightii), which was designed intentionally with no access to the internet.

As it currently stands, I have the program texting myself and few others with the location key hard coded into the program according to where they are.

My test code has a version with user input, but I have not yet learned how to format that with Twilio's API. 
The user input involves a back and forth interaction with the program, and so far I have only learned how to send a singular message through the Twilio API.

# License/Use
Please feel free to use this code! Accuweather has a free API, and Twilio is very inexpensive for a personal use context. 
If you would like to look at screens a bit less like me, this is could be of some use.
